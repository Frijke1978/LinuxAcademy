In this lesson, we will use the Terraform Console to view various Outputs that we can use for our scripts. The Terraform Console is extremely useful for troubleshooting and planning deployments.
# Download the latest Ghost Image
resource "docker_image" "image_id" {
  name = "ghost:latest"
}

# Start the Container
resource "docker_container" "container_id" {
  name  = "blog"
  image = "${docker_image.image_id.latest}"
  ports {
    internal = "2368"
    external = "80"
  }
}

#Output the IP Address of the Container
output "IP Address" {
  value = "${docker_container.container_id.ip_address}"
}

output "container_name" {
  value = "${docker_container.container_id.name}"
}
