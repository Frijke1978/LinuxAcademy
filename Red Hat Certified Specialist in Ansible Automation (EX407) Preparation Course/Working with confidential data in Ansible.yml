Instructions
In an effort to improve security, you have been tasked with securing an Ansible variable file. The variable file is to be used in an ansible job that creates a secure website. To do this, complete the following:
Encrypt the file /home/ansible/secret using ansible-vault. 
Then configure a vault password file named /home/ansible/vault to be used to run the Ansible playbook /home/ansible/secPage.yml successfully with the encrypted secrets file. 
Verify your work by running the secPage.yml playbook using ansible-playbook and specifying your vault password file. 
Test that the site deployed correctly by trying to access http://node1/secure/classified.html using the user bond with the password james.
Summary tasks list:
Encrypt home/ansible/secret using the ansible-vault command.
Create /home/ansible/vault as a vault password file that may be used to access the encrypted secret file without prompt.
Run the playbook /home/ansible/secPage.yml using your vault password file to validate your work.
Verify that the secure page deployed correctly by attempting to access http://node1/secure/classified.html as the user bond with the password james.
Important notes: 
For your convenience, Ansible has been installed on the control node.
/home/ansible/secPage.yml provides several examples of how to use various key ansible modules. It is worth looking at, but it should not require modification.
The user ansible is already on all servers with the appropriate shared keys for access to all necessary servers from the control node. 
The ansible user also has sudo access with no password. It has the same password as cloud_user. 
All necessary Ansible inventories have been created for you.
