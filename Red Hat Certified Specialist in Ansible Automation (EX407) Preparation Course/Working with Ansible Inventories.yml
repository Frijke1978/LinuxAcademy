Instructions
Your company has decided the backup software license is frivolous and unnecessary. As a consequence, the license has not renewed. Your supervisor has created a simple script and an ansible playbook to create a tar archive of select files depending on pre-defined Ansible host groups as a stop-gap measure. You will create the inventory file to completed the backup strategy. 
You must do the following:
Create the inventory file in /home/ansible/inventory.
Configure the host group media to contain media1 and media2.
Define the following variables for media with their accompanying values:
media_content should be set to /var/media/content/.
media_index should be set to /opt/media/mediaIndex.
Configure the host group webservers to contain the hosts web1 and web2.
Define the following variables for webservers with their accompanying values:
httpd_webroot should be set to /var/www/.
httpd_config should be set to /etc/httpd/.
Define the variable script_files for specifically for web1. The value of script_files should be set to /usr/local/scripts.
You can run /home/ansible/scripts/backup.sh to test your inventory. If you have correctly configured the inventory, it should not error.
Do not edit anything in /home/ansible/scripts/.
Important notes: 
For your convenience, Ansible has been installed on the control node.
The user ansible has been already created on all servers with appropriate shared keys for access to managed servers from the control node.
The ansible user has the same password as cloud_user.
/etc/hosts entries have been made on control1 for the managed servers.
Do not edit anything in /home/ansible/scripts/.
