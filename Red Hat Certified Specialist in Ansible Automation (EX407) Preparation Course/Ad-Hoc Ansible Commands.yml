Instructions
Some consultants have been employed to perform audits on a number of systems in your company's environment. You must create the user accounts noted in /home/ansible/userlist.txt and set up the provided public keys for their accounts. The security team has built a jump host for the consultants to access production systems and provided the full key-pair to you so you may set up and test the connection. All hosts in dbsystems will need the provided public key installed so the consultants may use key-pair authentication to access the systems. Also, you must ensure the auditd service is enabled and running on all systems.
To summarize, you must do the following:
Create the user accounts noted in /home/ansible/userlist.txt.
Copy the authorized_keys file for each user to the correct location so the new accounts can log in with ssh key authentication.
Ensure auditd is enabled and running on all systems.
Important notes: 
For your convenience, Ansible is already on the control node.
The user ansible is present on all servers with appropriate shared keys for access to managed servers from the control node.
The ansible user has the same password as cloud_user.
The default Ansible inventory has been configured for you with the appropriate hosts and groups.
/etc/hosts entries are present on control1 for the managed servers.
