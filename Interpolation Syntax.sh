In this lesson, we will learn about Terraforms interpolation syntax and deploy a container from our Docker image. 
# Download the latest Ghost image
resource "docker_image" "image_id" {
  name = "ghost:latest"
}

# Start the Container
resource "docker_container" "container_id" {
  name  = "blog"
  image = "${docker_image.image_id.latest}"
  ports {
    internal = "2368"
    external = "80"
  }
}
