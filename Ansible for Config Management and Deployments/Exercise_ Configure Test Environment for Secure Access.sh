Exercise: Configure Test Environment for Secure Access 

[user@tcox4 ~]$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/user/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/user/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
b8:49:0a:1f:71:f9:0c:54:c8:8e:30:9b:93:b3:3c:bf user@tcox4.mylabserver.com
The key's randomart image is:
+--[ RSA 2048]----+
|     ..o.        |
|  o  .o.         |
|   *.o+          |
|  * .o.=         |

2. Exchange the public key with 'Server2' and the 'user' account on that server. Verify that the identity appearing in the appropriate key file matches the user and system name/IP of the originating 'Server1'.
[user@tcox4 .ssh]$ ssh-copy-id 54.86.179.231
The authenticity of host '54.86.179.231 (54.86.179.231)' can't be established.
ECDSA key fingerprint is 0d:0c:b1:1d:e1:cf:6d:9f:51:bf:0f:dc:60:82:a1:73.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes

user@54.86.179.231's password:

Now try logging into the machine, with:   "ssh '54.86.179.231'"
and check to make sure that only the key(s) you wanted were added.

3. Verify that you are able to log into 'Server2' from 'Server1' with the 'user' account without entering a password. Check the hostname file to be sure you are logged into 'Server2'.
[user@tcox4 .ssh]$ ssh 54.86.179.231
Last login: Mon Sep 21 14:22:42 2015 from 216.46.60.98
[user@tcox5 .ssh]$ hostname
tcox5.mylabserver.com
 
4. Repeat Step #1 for 'Server2' (creating and exchanging the 'user' SSH keys with 'Server1'). Create a file on 'Server1' using any method you choose. Use 'secure copy' to copy that file to 'Server2'. Confirm the copy succeeds without password entry.
[user@tcox4 ~]$ echo "test file" > testfile.txt
[user@tcox4 ~]$ scp testfile.txt 54.86.179.231:/home/user
testfile.txt 
 
5. Using 'secure copy', copy the file from Step #4 back to 'Server1' from 'Server2', renaming it to something else during the copy process, verify that no password was required.
[user@tcox4 ~]$ scp 54.86.179.231:/home/user/testfile.txt copiedfrom.txt
testfile.txt                                                                                                                                                                   100%   10     0.0KB/s   00:00
