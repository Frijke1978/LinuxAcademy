1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.

    [test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version

    ansible 1.9.2

      configured module search path = None

 

2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.

[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts

    tcox5.mylabserver.com

    localhost

    tcox4.mylabserver.com

 

3. Create a playbook, using the 'STEP INTO' concepts from the video:

- Uses SSH

- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user

- Connects to one server or group from Step #2 above

- The playbook runs as 'sudo'

- Skip gathering remote facts

- Uses three separate, named, tasks to install three packages (your choice)

    --- # START AT PLAYBOOK EXAMPLE

    - hosts: apacheweb

      user: test

      sudo: yes

      connection: ssh

      gather_facts: no

      tasks:

      - name: Install Telnet

        yum: pkg=telnet state=latest

      - name: Install Lynx

        yum: pkg=lynx state=latest

      - name: Install at

        yum: pkg=at state=latest
