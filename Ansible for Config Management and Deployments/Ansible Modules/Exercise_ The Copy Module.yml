

1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.

    [test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version

    ansible 1.9.2

      configured module search path = None

 

2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.

    [test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts

        tcox5.mylabserver.com

        localhost

        tcox4.mylabserver.com

     

 

3. Create a playbook, using the 'service' module that accomplishes the following:

- Uses SSH

- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user

- Connects to one server or group from Step #2 above

- The playbook runs as 'sudo'

- Copies a file from a local directory called 'files' and a file called 'text4.txt' (created separately) to the /home/test directory remotely

    [test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim copy.yml

    [test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat copy.yml

    --- # COPY MODULE EXAMPLE

    - hosts: apacheweb

      user: test

      sudo: yes

      connection: ssh

      gather_facts: no

      tasks:

      - name: Copy from the files directory test file

        action: copy src=files/test4.txt dest=/home/test/test4.txt owner=test group=test mode=0655 backup=yes

    [test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cd files

    [test@tcox3 files]$ echo "this is text 4" > text4.txt

 

4. Run the playbook and display the results.

    [test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook copy.yml
