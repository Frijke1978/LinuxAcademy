1. Verify that your ansible installation is available by displaying the version of ansible while logged in as the 'user' user.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible --version
ansible 1.9.2
  configured module search path = None
 
2. Run the ansible command that lists all of the hosts configured in your control server 'hosts' file for the system.
[test@tcox3 ~]$ ansible all --list-hosts
    tcox5.mylabserver.com
    localhost
    tcox4.mylabserver.com
 
3. Create a playbook, using the 'acl' module that accomplishes the following:
- Uses SSH
- Logs in to the remote system as 'test' user
- Connects to all the hosts from Step #2 above
- The playbook runs as 'sudo'
- Skip gathering remote facts
- Sets user ACL characteristics on a remote file such that for the user called 'user', they have 'read/write' permissions on a file they would otherwise not have
- Register the results of that command into a variable and use the 'debug' module to display the JSON formatted output of the ACL module changes
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ vim acl.yml
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ cat acl.yml
--- # ACL MODULE EXAMPLE
- hosts: apacheweb
  user: test
  sudo: yes
  connection: ssh
  gather_facts: no
  tasks:
    - name: Get ACL Information on the /etc/test.acl.txt remote file
      acl: name=/etc/test.acl.txt entity=test etype=user permissions="rw" state=absent
      register: aclinfo
    - debug: var=aclinfo
 
4. Run the playbook and display the results.
[test@tcox3 Playbooks]$ ansible-playbook acl.yml
